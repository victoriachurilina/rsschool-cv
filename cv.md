My background is more than 10 years of experience as a front office supervisor and hotel guide. For the last 6 months, I am learning front-end and I am starving to success as a web developer. I am in love with design and working hard to be professional in Figma and to get the basis of art design. My English level is intermediate and I am practicing it regularly by reading books as I can talk fluently but my dictionary needed to be improved.

My soft skills are included a passion to learn, a high sense of responsibility, dedication, attention to detail, empathy, and communication skills.
My weaknesses are incompetence to delegate tasks and overthinking.

### Examples of code

```
function multiply(a, b){
return a \* b;
}
```
