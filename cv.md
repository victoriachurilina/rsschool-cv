```
 My background is more than 10 years experience as a hotelier and hotel's guide. For the last 6 months I am learning front-end as I am starving to success as a web developer.

My soft skills are included passion to learn, high sense of responsibility, dedication, attention to details, empathy and communication skills.
My weaknesses are incompetence to delegate the tasks and overthinking.

### Examples of code

function multiply(a, b){
return a \* b;
}
